# Key-Logger
Making a key logger tool while taking the ethical hacking course.

The following info will be the instructions on how to set up the workspace needed to make this yourself, as well as how it works and other concepts:
- This is for Windows. We need to install python. 
  - Google and download Sublime Text.
  - Run
  - Change settings according to your liking
  - print "hello" and save as a .py file. Now you can see what a python file looks like.
  - Install python2 and python3. (for Windows)
  - In the same folder you have the downloaded python versions, try to run your hello world program. 
- Now we can start making the keylogger.
  - In pycharm create new project. (or just use vim for all of this specifying that it is a .py file except for the .txt output file)
  - Create new file in pyinput and call it your key logger
